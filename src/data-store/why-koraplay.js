    title: 'Obscurity in creators rewards',
    explanation:
      'Traditional social media and entertainment platforms thrive on the genius of the creators within such platforms. However, these creators have no control over their content’s distributions and the revenues generated. In addition, there is limited insight into who engages with the contents; and information asymmetry over payout structure significantly affects the earnings of upcoming creators.',

  {
    id: 2,
    title: 'Centralized Control',
    explanation:
      'Content ownership rights implicitly reside with the administration of traditional platforms. As a result, the platforms profit more from content than the creators, with absolute discretion over platform administration, deciding who stays or leaves and defining inappropriate content as they deem fit.',
    image: img02,
  },

  {
    id: 3,
    title: 'Nonexistent Fan Earning & Governance',
    explanation:
      'Real consumers of content on social media and entertainment platforms deserve to contribute to the platform’s administration. However, this is not the case. Users who do not create content derive no direct economic value and have no governance rights.',
    image: img03,
  },

  {
    id: 4,
    title: 'User Data Privacy',
    explanation:
      'User data are often shared across platforms, sometimes for gains accruable to the owners of some centralized platforms. These practices infringe on user privacy, and it is one of the problems of traditional platforms.',
    image: img04,
  },

  {
    id: 5,
    title: 'Expensive charges',
    explanation:
      'Users pay subscription fees to use various traditional entertainment platforms. Unfortunately, the prices are usually high, and the platforms offer little to no monetary return to the subscribers while making a lot of money from their activities.',
    image: img05,
  },

  {
    id: 6,
    title: 'Payment delays',
    explanation:
      'The structured level of intermediaries adds another layer of problem for creators, resulting in payment delays.',
